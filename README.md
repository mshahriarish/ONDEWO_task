# The objective:
To perform a simple spell check using deep neural network.
## The Methods
I used two different methods to perform the spel-check.

1.As the first Neural network, I used a LSTM nueral network to performs the spell check.


2.As the second example, I introduced a pre-trained character based embedding layer for the input.

## To Do When I Have Time:

1. Train the neural network using a GPU.

2. Train the networks using different configurations to find the best configuration possible.

3. Work on the architecture of the network to achive the best one.

4. Perform a more in depth cleaning to consider more special characters.

5. Adapt my network for German and Finish.
