# The objective:
To perform a simple spell check using deep neural network.
## The methods
I used two different methods to perform the spel-check.

1.As the first Neural network, I used a LSTM nueral network to performs the spell check.


2.As the second example, I introduced a pre-trained character based embedding layer for the input.
